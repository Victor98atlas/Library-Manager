This project is a library management system which is completely programmed using c++.To initialize this project,I would personally recommend you run it on the terminal using gcc compiler.
After downloading the project on the terminal type the command gcc library.c++ and then type .\a.exe on the terminal to run it. The reason I personally recommend running on the terminal is 
because compiling and run time is better and you can run it on VSC too but I do not have instructions on how to run it properly.I hope you would appreciate my project and please feel free to 
share you comments about this project and do remind me on what changes to be done in the project.

Thanking You
